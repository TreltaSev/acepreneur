  <h3>Curious about your BMI?</h3>
  <h4 style="opacity:60%;">
    Our Sports Medicine program will also be providing complimentary Body Mass
    Index (BMI) calculations. This is a perfect way to get started on a
    potential weight loss journey or to learn about how your measurements
    compare to people at the same age and height.
